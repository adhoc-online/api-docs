## Test Account

All customers have a test account. This account has a lower rate limit,
doesn't synchronize with 3rd-party services and doesn't count towards your
paid plan quota. For that reason this account is recommended for development
and tests.

To utilize your test account, use its respective API token. It's visible in
your dashboard. In production, use your main API token.

<aside class="notice">
Your test account's API token is different from the production account's
API token.
