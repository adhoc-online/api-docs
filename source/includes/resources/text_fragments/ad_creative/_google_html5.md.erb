**html5**

HTML5 banners on Google Ads enables more sophisticated ads. You build the HTML,
ZIP it and send to us the file URL, we then upload it to Google.

This is equivalent to Template Ad 419 on Google. For now only
[Uploaded HTML5 bundle](https://developers.google.com/adwords/api/docs/appendix/templateads#html5_upload_V1) is supported.

Not everyone can use this ad format on Google.
Read are the
[requirements here](https://ads-developers.googleblog.com/2018/08/upcoming-changes-to-html5-template-ads.html).

Because these files are sent and processed by Google asynchronously, you need to
check back on whether Google reported errors with your banner. In case it does,
you need to send a new file (editing the old ad isn't possible).

These are the data format you have to provide. See the example on the side.

**type:** `html5`.

**spec:** These are the keys you have to provide.

- `zip_url (string)`: the URL to your zipfile containing the banner. Here's

- `width (integer)`: width of the banner in pixels, e.g `300`. See

- `height (integer)`: height of the banner in pixels, e.g `250`. See
  [this](https://developers.google.com/adwords/api/docs/appendix/templateads#html5_upload_V1) for what numbers you can use.
