Each service (Google, Facebook etc) provides different features.
Define them on an ad-by-ad basis.

For example, Google's _expanded text ad_ requires a headline, a second headline
and a description body, whereas Facebook's _image ad_ requires images, a body,
a title. For each `ad-type` a different set of `data` needs to be used.

If you need a different type of ad or banner which is not available below,
get in touch with us.

Below you will find what you have to pass as `data` depending on the `ad-type`
value you chose.
