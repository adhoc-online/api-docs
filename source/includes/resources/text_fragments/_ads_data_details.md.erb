Each service (Google, Facebook etc) provide different features. To be able to
use them, you have to define them on an ad-by-ad basis.

For example, Google's _expanded text ads_ require a headline, a seconds headline
and a description body, whereas Facebook's _image ads_ require images, a body,
a title. For each `ad-type` a different set of `data` needs to be defined.

If you need a different type of ad or banner which is not available below,
get in touch with us.

Below you will find what you have to pass as `data` depending on the `ad-type`
value you chose.
