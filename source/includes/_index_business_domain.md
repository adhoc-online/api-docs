## What I Need To Know

This API has 2 main areas:

- **Organization:** this is your company. Use this namespace to access ad
  accounts, to create Accounts and configure billing.
- **Accounts:** use Accounts to separate marketing campaigns with Accounts. For
  agencies, this means having 1 Organization and many Accounts, one for each
  client. For non-agencies you'll probably have only one account.

These areas on the sidebar.
